# Implementation-of-integer-multiplication-in-time-O-nlogn-using-Verilog-HDL
Project optimizes integer multiplication using Schӧnhage–Strassen algorithm &amp; Fast Fourier Transform in Verilog HDL. Achieves O(nlogn) bit operations, ideal for large integers. Implemented in Intel Quartus Prime &amp; ModelSim, significantly reduces time complexity, addressing NP-type problems.
